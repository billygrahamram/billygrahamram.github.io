## Course Objectives:
As a teaching assistant I was tasked with conducting four lab classes. The primary objective was to introduce undergraduate level students about the possibilities in precision agriculture
with the help of python programming. Due to the basic level of the course. The labs were divided into two parts. In the first part, comprising of lab 1 and lab 2, students were introduced to 
python programming syntax, and in the second part (lab 3 & 4) the students were introduced to PlantCV and it's use in highthroughput pheonotyping problems.

In the four weeks lab session of 2.5 hours each. The objectives were:

+ Breaking ice with programming.
+ Introduction to Python language basic syntax.
+ Introduction to how python can be used for precision agriculture.
+ Tutorials on plant image segmentation and leaf count using PlantCV library.
