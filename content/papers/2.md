##### Abstract

Herbicide-resistant weed species are one of the largest threats to modern agriculture, as ineffective weed control results in significant yield losses or increased costs through alternatives such as mechanical methods. Palmer amaranth
(Amaranthus palmeri S. Watson) has been one of the most troublesome weeds. Its identification through the adoption of sitespecific weed management systems will help farmers select more appropriate control options to reduce costs and improve
efficacy, resulting in increased farm revenue. In this study, a pixel-wised method was evaluated for the classification of
Palmer amaranth and soybean (Glycine max L.). A pushbroom hyperspectral imagery acquisition system was used to collect
imagery from 224 spectral bands ranging from 400 to 1000 nm. Greenhouse experiments were conducted in three different
runs. Greenhouse-grown plants were evaluated to generate predictive models from paired samples generated with 56 replications in each run. Data collection occurred weekly when Palmer amaranth plants were between approximately 2.5 and
12.7 cm tall. Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and soft independent modeling of class analogy (SIMCA)
were tested to classify Palmer amaranth and soybean. Half of the dataset (Palmer amaranth = 42, soybean = 42) was used
to train the models, and the other half (Palmer amaranth = 42, soybean = 42) was used to test model performance. Preliminary results showed that the PLS-DA model with PLS factors as input had a cumulative variation (R2
Y(cum)) of 60% and predictive ability (Q2 Y(cum)) of 60%. The SIMCA model showed a cumulative variation of 85% and a predictive ability of 82%. Overall, this study illustrated the capability of hyperspectral imagery to classify Palmer amaranth and soybean, which will increase the efficiency of weed control in modern agriculture.
