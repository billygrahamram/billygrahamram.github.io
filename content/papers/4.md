description: "The review analyzed 60 technical research papers on weed detection published in the past decade. The authors investigated research gaps in the use of deep learning techniques for weed detection and discussed novel deep learning approaches for weed identification. This review provides valuable insights into the current state of research on weed management in precision agriculture and highlights the potential of deep learning techniques for improving weed detection." 

summary: "In this study, we present a novel approach for categorizing soybean seeds using a Hyperspectral Imaging system and machine learning. Our method focuses on the seeds’ ability to yield high-quality gypsum tofu. We’ve designed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that effectively sorts soybeans into four groups, with prediction accuracies between 96% and 99%. The model, built on ten chosen spectral bands, is both reliable and efficient. Additionally, we’ve deduced the chemical makeup linked to these bands, offering vital data for tofu quality prediction."

##### Abstract

Soybean seeds are a key ingredient for producing quality tofu. Conventional methods
for assessing soybean seed quality for tofu are time-consuming and labor-intensive.
This study employs hyperspectral imaging (HSI) and machine learning to rapidly
predict gypsum tofu quality from soybean seeds. Two hundred soybean seed varieties
were classified into four categories based on tofu quality using hierarchical clustering.
Hyperspectral scans of the soybean seeds were captured in the 900-1700 nm range.
Using the Extreme Gradient Boost (XGBoost) algorithm, ten critical wavelengths were
identified that correlate with protein, carbohydrate, and oil contents. A Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) model was subsequently developed, trained on HSI data from
the soybean categories. For new soybean seeds, this CNN model successfully
categorized them into distinct quality classes with 96-99% accuracy. Further validation
through tofu production demonstrated the model's robustness in predicting key tofu
quality parameters like yield, firmness and springiness. Overall, this pioneering
research enabled rapid, non-destructive prediction of tofu quality from soybean seeds
using HSI and CNN. With further refinements, this approach could revolutionize
soybean seed quality assessment.
