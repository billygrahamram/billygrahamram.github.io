description: "This research focused on the development and comparison of nine supervised machine-learning models for data analysis. A hyperspectral data collection platform was created specifically for field data collection, enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of the process. The study also examined the effectiveness of Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) and F1 scores in handling imbalanced datasets. After rigorous training and comparison, a Quadratic Discriminant Classifier was chosen due to its impressive F1 score of 0.95 and MCC of 0.85, demonstrating its superior performance in classifying and predicting data."

##### Abstract

Weed infestation and their management are a critical production challenge in agricultural fields. Palmer amaranth has created management challenges because it has multiple emergence pattern and has evolved resistant to nine unique herbicide sites of action. Effective Palmer amaranth detection and positive identification in field conditions will help to improve Palmer amaranth control. A field-based hyperspectral imaging system was developed to record Palmer amaranth in soybean fields. The data were pre-processed applying Savitzky-Golay 2nd derivative, Multiplicative Scatter Correction, and Standard Normal Variate in a forward feed manner. Recursive feature elimination, SelectFromModel, sequential forward selection, and backward elimination were used to select significant wavebands from the available 224 bands. Later, supervised machine-learning models were generated to classify soybean and Palmer amaranth using the selected wavebands. Matthew’s correlation coefficient (MCC), F1 score, precision, and recall were considered as the most significant parameters to evaluate the model’s performance. The highest result was obtained by quadratic discriminant analysis with a prediction accuracy of 93.95%, a precision of 90.30%, a recall of 90.29%, an F1 score of 0.95, and an MCC score of 0.85. The findings of this study showed that the combination of hyperspectral imaging and machine-learning is a potential technique for real-time weed detection in the open field condition.
