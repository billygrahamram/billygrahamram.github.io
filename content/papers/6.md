description: "This research focused on the development and comparison of nine supervised machine-learning models for data analysis. A hyperspectral data collection platform was created specifically for field data collection, enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of the process. The study also examined the effectiveness of Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) and F1 scores in handling imbalanced datasets. After rigorous training and comparison, a Quadratic Discriminant Classifier was chosen due to its impressive F1 score of 0.95 and MCC of 0.85, demonstrating its superior performance in classifying and predicting data."

##### Abstract

With the advent of precision agriculture, data is seen as a valuable resource for optimizing crop yields and improving farming practices. Different sensors provide distinct and valuable perspectives on plant behavior with the help of data. Hyperspectral imaging is data rich in solving agricultural problems like disease detection, weed detection, stress detection, crop monitoring, nutrient application, soil mineralogy, yield estimation, and sorting applications. With modern precision agriculture, the challenge now is to bring these applications to the field for real-time solutions, where machines are enabled to carry out these analyses without expert supervision and communicate the results to users for better management of farmlands; a necessary step to gain complete autonomy in agriculture. Significant advancements in hyperspectral imaging technology for precision agriculture are required to fully realize its potential. As a wide-ranging collection of the status of hyperspectral imaging and analysis in precision agriculture is lacking, this review endeavors to provide a comprehensive overview of the recent advancements and trends in high spatial resolution hyperspectral imaging for precision agriculture for real-time applications. In this study, a systematic review of 163 scientific articles published over the past twenty years (2003-2023) was conducted. Of these, 97 were selected for further analysis based on their relevance to the topic at hand. Topics include conventional data preprocessing techniques, hyperspectral data acquisition, data compression methods, and segmentation methods. The hardware implementation of field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and graphics processing units (GPUs) for high-speed data processing and application of machine learning and deep learning technologies were explored. This review highlights the potential of hyperspectral imaging as a powerful tool for precision agriculture, particularly in real-time applications, discusses limitations, and provides insights into future research directions.
